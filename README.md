# Quicksort_C
Write quicksort code for data given as linked list instead of as array. Do not copy

the data in an array, but work in all stages with linked lists.

Make first one pass over the list to find the length of the list, then a second pass to find

the random comparison element, then a third pass to partition the list into the smaller

and the larger items. Both lists are sorted in recursive calls, then you put the two lists

and the comparison element in the right sequence together, and return the now-sorted

list. Be careful about empty lists.
